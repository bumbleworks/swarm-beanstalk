# Swarm::Beanstalk

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/swarm-beanstalk.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/swarm-beanstalk)

By default, the [swarm](http://github.com/bumbleworks/swarm) workflow engine only comes with a volatile in-process worker.  This gem gives you a non-volatile worker using the awesome [beanstalkd](http://kr.github.io/beanstalkd/) work queue (via [beaneater](https://github.com/beanstalkd/beaneater)).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'swarm-beanstalk'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install swarm-beanstalk

## Usage
